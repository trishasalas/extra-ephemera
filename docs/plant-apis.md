# Plant APIs

1. Trefle.io - Global plants database with care info, distribution, scientific data. Has a free tier.
2. Perenual - Plant hardiness zones, care guides, watering needs. Good for houseplants and garden plants.
3. GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility) - Scientific occurrence data, taxonomy. More academic but comprehensive.
4. iNaturalist - Community science API, observations, identifications. Great for real-world plant data.
5. PlantNet - Plant identification API if you want to add "identify this plant" features from photos.
6. USDA Plants Database - No official API but the data is queryable. Very comprehensive for US plants.
